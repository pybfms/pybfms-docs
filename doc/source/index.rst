PyBfms Documentation
====================

The PyBfms project provides infrastructure for creating 
Bus Functional Models (BFMs) to interface between a Python-based
testbench and an HDL simulation environment. PyBfms currently
supports the cocotb testbench library, but is designed to
be able to support other Python testbench libraries.
