# Initialization Process
The initialization process is a bit different for different BFM 
language/interface bindings. In all cases, CoCoTB is used as the
core interface library.

## SystemVerilog/DPI Interface

- Interface code is a .c file that is generated by the BFM-core
tools. The interface code consists of:
  - Registration of the Python API package
  - Interface functions for cross-calling
  - The SystemVerilog BFM module both triggers initialization and 
    provides interface tasks

- Simulator's "StartOfSimulation" VPI hook initializes CoCoTB
  - Is this relevant?
  
- Simulator's static initialization calls DPI initialization
  code to register Python module with Python infrastructure
  
- Simulator's "Time-0 Callback" brings up CoCoTB library, and
  loads BFM Python packages
